# ReciepeApp
# User Interface (UI): The app features a minimum of three ViewControllers, ensuring a dynamic and engaging user experience. Through thoughtful UI design, I ensured I created a visually appealing and intuitive app.
# API Data Integration: To demonstrate proficiency in working with real-time data, the app fetchs API data from a web service. This involved making HTTP requests, receiving responses, and decoding the data within the app. Rather than relying on pre-existing data from GitHub repositories, this project emphasizes the integration of actual API data.
# AutoLayout for Orientation Support: To ensure optimal user experience across different device orientations, the app must implement AutoLayout. This will enable the app to adapt to both landscape and portrait modes seamlessly, providing a consistent and visually appealing layout across various screen sizes.
